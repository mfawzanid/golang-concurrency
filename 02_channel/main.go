/*
Channels are typed communication pipelines that allow goroutines to safely and synchronously exchange data.
They provide a way to send and receive values of a specific type, enabling coordination and data sharing between concurrent operations.

We simulate the use of a channel by modeling a typical order processing flow.
Once an order is completed, it triggers a series of follow up notifications.
These notifications are not critical to the main business flow and can be handled asynchronously.
