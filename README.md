# Go Concurrency Playground ðŸš€

This repository is a hands-on learning resource to understand **concurrency in Go** through practical simulations and examples.

Each topic is organized in its own folder with self-contained, well-commented `main.go` files that demonstrate key concepts of Go's concurrency model.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

| Folder            | Topic Description                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `01_goroutine`    | Introduction to goroutines (lightweight threads)  |
| `02_channel`      | Communication between goroutines using channels   |
| `03_range_close`  | [Coming soon] Using `range` and `close` with channels            |
| ...               | More topics coming...                              |

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- How Go handles concurrency with goroutines
- Sending and receiving data using channels
- Common patterns and pitfalls in concurrent Go programs

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run an example:

```bash
cd 01_goroutine  # or any other topic folder
go run main.go
```

Each `main.go` contains:
- A simulated real-world use case
- Commentary explaining behavior
- Optional experiments to deepen understanding

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Go syntax
- Go installed

## ðŸ’¡ Contributions

Feel free to open issues or submit PRs with improvements, additional concurrency patterns, or real-world use case simulations.

Happy Go coding!
